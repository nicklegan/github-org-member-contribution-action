# GitHub Organization Member Contribution Action

> A GitHub Action that generates a report which contains member contribution data for a set interval belonging to a GitHub organization.

## Usage

The example [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) below runs on a monthly [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) and can be executed manually using a [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#manual-events) event.

```yml
name: Member Contribution Report

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *' # Runs on the first day of the month at 00:00

jobs:
  member-contribution-report:
    
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Get Member Contributions
        uses: nicklegan/member-contribution-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ORG_TOKEN }}
```
